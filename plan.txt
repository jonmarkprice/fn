PLAN:

Try make as series of sm. indep. files, which each do one thing.
We don't need a db right off the bat.
We could have a series of functions which read generic JSON wrt to where it is
coming from.

What are the user stories:

Add an ecosystem function
Add an ecosystem
Add a common function (interview)

Get all functions in a given ecosystem

Might be able to due ~Half of this with just:
1. one file per table
2. jq
3. awk or sim. for formatting (map stdin -> stdout)

Then add simple server + curl.
